#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Give advice like a billionaire mentor  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized golden crown atop a sleek black background, with subtle silver accents and a faint glow, symbolizing wealth and wisdom. The crown should have intricate filigree, a small emerald at its center, and a subtle gradient from gold to deep amber. The background should be a dark charcoal with a subtle texture, giving depth. The overall composition should convey prestige, success, and mentorship.
